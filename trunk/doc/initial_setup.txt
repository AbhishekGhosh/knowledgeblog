This document describes the inital setup for the KnowledgeBlog development process.

** Apache Configuration

Running 2 virtual hosts. First serves *.knowledgeblog.org from /var/www
 * Version 3.0.1 - updated by WP updater.

Second serves tomatin.vm.bytemark.co.uk from /home/beta/wordpress
 * Version 3.0.1 - updated by Subversion 

** Wordpress/MySQL Configuration

Both WordPresses are same user, different databases.

** Versioning

Main repo /home/beta/version/knowledgeblog 

Working copy /home/beta/beta-checkout/trunk

** To publish

1. Push personal repo to Main repo
2. bzr pull in beta-checkout as user beta
3. make in beta-checkout/trunk/publish as user beta








** Setup notes

Had to do lots of chmod'ing on bzr repo to get this to work, but it does seem
okay now.
