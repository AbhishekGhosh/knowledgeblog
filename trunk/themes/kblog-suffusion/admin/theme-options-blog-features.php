				Suffusion uses the excellent <a href='http://www.malsup.com/jquery/cycle/'>JQuery Cycle</a> to create a Featured section above your posts.
				Additionally you can define a \"Featured Image\" (preferably as wide as your blog posts). If you don't associate a featured image, the thumbnail will be picked.
				And if you don't provide a thumbnail, the first attached image will be used. Note, though, that not having a featured image will generate thumbnail size images, displaying a lot of blank space.
				Good practices:
				<ul class='margin-20'>
					<li>Use featured images for every post that you want to show in your featured section.</li>
					<li>Define featured images that are at least as wide as your posts.</li>
					<li>Don't use too many featured posts. Remember that this section should have useful information, not all information. Having too many posts will make your script sluggish.</li>
