This is a test of latex math mode support. 

\section{Purpose of test}

To test problematic equations to see whether they work. 

\section{Pass Condition}

All equations should render. Those equations in known failures are known to be
broken, so it's a failure, but expected. 

\section{Test Materials}



This is a simple equation to make sure latex rendering is working at all:
$E=mc^{2}$

This is the same equation with the alternate slash, bracket syntax:
\(E=mc^{2}\)



\section{Known Failures in wp-Latex}


From sample2e:  \( a_{1} > x^{2n} + y^{2n} > x' \)

  \( a_{1} x^{2n} > + y ^{2n} > x' \)
